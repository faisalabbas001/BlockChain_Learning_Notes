its notes is fallow this exapmle >->>>>>>>>>

suppose in marrage hall so you have been recived that invitation and you have went the party and when you have enter in the 

marrage hall so the gard check your invitation so and guard has check that yo record in the book which has been guard set 

for all guest record its suppose like ledger so its check that ask you go that so you know that in this its accorately fully 

security like enter that the unotherized person and perfrom any illegal activtity its very hramfull for all people 
 

so in this seceneriou we have appllied that the BlockChain so like when the guest has been enter in the marrage hall so 

guard has been check that its card and guard has been give that all list for the other people who has already enter in the hall

so in this list all comming guest record has been saved so guard has been make that copy and give that all people who has been 

in marrage hall so like when the new person has been enter that and guard has been annoucned that its named and all people 

has been in hall so its already have list who people gust coming from all people has been checked that who comming people 

when the unotherized person has been enter that its quickly caugth that its has unotherized person so in this guard has been 

 set that the data Centralizes means not stored data at one place  so using the BlockChain we can be easily data 

Decentralized so in this the guard has been stored that the data has Decentralized so means the guard has been shared that 

data all people all guest has access all data 



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  ________________________________________________________________ >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


what is the BlockChain  -->

open distributed  ledger that can record transctions between two parties efficently  and in a verifiable  and 

permanent way !!!!!  

ledger ->>>>  ledger is the record of that the data which has been stored like information store  ... store like note  Book

Data Centralizes ->>>>>.   its means that the data has been stored only one person like admin or one person

Data Decentralized -->>>>.  its means that the data has been all person all people which has been eaily check that example

is that the data has been access any one all memebers nodes

the Data Decentralized has been used in BlockChain 

CryptoGrapgy->>>>>>   its means that you have been made that the readable data into unreadable form 

example that when  you write that faisal so you convert to werwe234234234 its means that CryptoGrapgy

Crypto means that hidden and grappy means write its fully is write that the hidden information 


encryption --->>>> its means that you have been write that simple word in to machine word like 

you have been write that faisal and you have been convert that in encyption 

Decription ->>>. its has been opposite that when you have been get that the machine code like 

asdhaskjd234234hjk its Decription that faisal so its Decription


Benefits of BlockChain

transparency  ->>  using that build that the trust  when two parties has been build that the trust that 

 so automaitcally the third party has been removed that like banks and other things ....

 no single point of failure  ->>>>

  its means that when the laedger has been damage that and like store has been damage that so nothing has been the problem is 

  that like you know that BlockChain provide that the facilty all member have records 

  security  ->>>>>>

    real time tracking --->>>>

    its has been not changed that ---- >>>

    like when you have been write that the any  things you have been not remove that you just added 

    its not good and so add new one its better approach for security to detect data  from the hacker 

    no third party has been included that in this - >>> 

     example that the bank  and other  things has been not included that in this 

     trusted transctions  --->>>

     reduced cost -->>>

                 --->>>>>    Smart Contract  --->>>

 the smart contract is the promise between two parties like expamle 

 one party has been sell the propert to second party so these party  has been done the smart contract in this 

its has been no any need of the third party when the one party has been give the property second party 
using that the crytptocurrency its has been send that bitcoins automatically 


     ->>>>>>>>>> Types of BlockChain  ->>>>>>>>>>>

     (1)   public BlockChain

     its like  politics parties in which all worker like a node so simpe in computer system 

     is the parties has been announce that any one has been fill the form join the parties so 

     this is public BlockChain 

     (2)  Private BlockChain

      its like that in software house many emlpoyees has been working that so thease employees has been

      set that service is private means when the new employees has been join that its has been not access that 

      the service of the present emlpoyees so its private BlockChain

       its has been more used that compare to public BlockChain 

       many company and agencies and other its has made that internal restriction so its fully made that private and work that

  

       (3)   HyBridge BlockChain   //   Federated  BlockChain   

            in this  you have been give some access give to the public and you have been set  that instruction  / main accuess  private 
             
            in this you have been some give the permission to the public 



    ->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    Nodes ->>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  
    node like computer which has been conncted with each other   

    in this marrage hall expamle every guest as node so when the new guest has been arrived that and enter in hall 

     and when its name has been annoucned that so other nodes has been check that over ledger so when some node has 

     dotues like this comming node has unotherized so its has been check that record to other node like discuess its 

     called communication between node 


     -----  >>>>>   Types of Nodes  ---->>>>

     (1)  Full Node

     its node has been stored that all data has been stroed that  


Example is ->  in family you know that the elder brother has all know information about the home and the little bother has 

  know limited knowledge of the home so the elder brother is called Full Node and the little brother is called light Node

     (2) Light Node

     in this relevent data has been stored that which has been verify that 

     (3)   Mining Node

  its like in family member  you have been give the responsibiltiy you have been give that like you have been only done this 

   role its so its Mining Node  


->>>>  Hash ->>>>>>>

Hash means  that convert text or  information readable into  unreadable so like example

convert using the Hash Function  readable into unreadable

minhaj University Lahore ->>>>>   EFYTU875456575BGNMKLJUR

Hash has been generated through text or information when the text or information has been changed that 

the hash has automatically changed that 


--->>  Block -->

Block  means that the when the two or many people has been done the transctions  its goes into Block like Container 


 and then the minner like admin verify that and pass the block into BlockChain  


 Block is the place in BlockChain where information and data has been stroed in encrypted 


 ---->  blockchain ---->>>

 in BlockChain the the block has been connected with each other like first has been generated that the hash and the second has 

  made that the first and the third has been made that the second hash so this prcedure has been using that in blockchain 


---> Mining in BlockChain ---->>>>

 (1) What is the Mining  ???

minner is person or computer how to been verified that the transctions and record and give the permission to the 

the Block go in BlockChain  lock the Block which has been verified and store  into BlockChain


----->>> Discuss About that the DataBase and BlockChain ---->>>>

(1)  Authority  

IN Database the all information of the user has been fully access that the admin like Example is 

 the facebook owner has all user data profiles and images when the user has been create that the profile and uploads 

 that the image and data in the facebook the data has been stored in the facebook its fully accuess of the admin Mark Zerekberg

 IN BlockChain all nodes like people/computer has been conncted with eachother and all node has been get that information

 of node and easily communicate with eachother like data has been Decentralized  when one node has been change that the data


 in all node records has been changed that 

 (2)  Architecture 

BlockChain is distributed and the DataBase has client serverice

client ->>  client is over computer broswer in which we have been enter that the data as input like interface

we have been input data so its client 

server   ->>  its point that the data or information has been stored that 


 (3)   DataHnadling ->>>  

BlockChain:   
in this only has been readable and writeable 
nothing has been other its made powerfull to the BlockChain  
like in BlockChain store we can be only read and write data 

    Data
    /   /
   /    /
  /     /
 /      /
Read     Write 

Convenstional DataBase ||  Tradional DataBase

 in this data has been read write and delete and edit 


 CRUD ->>  read || write || update || delete

 perform all opertions in DataBase 



(3)  intergrity 

in BlockChain Nothing has been Data  changed that but in DataBases you can been eaily changed that data and information


(4) Cost 

Today BlockChain has been cost but when the harddrive has been fast that well its has been less 

but the DataBase has been less not  need for any cost 



(5) Performance  


DataBase faster than BlockChain in DataBase Data has been stored in One place but in BlockChain the Data has been 

stored Decentralized  like in BlockChain netwok 1000 node has been conncted that in these the data has been share that 

its has been take some time 



++++++++++++>>>>   Consensus mechnism  Algorithm BlockChain ++++++++++++++ >>>>>>

in blockchain many way to get that the reviews  || descion  of the node 

every company has made that own BlockChain  like weiBlock has made own BlockChain  and other things 

in its depends on the company has made that blockchain according to own need

its depends on the you have been set that nodes and who make the minging ........


Example ->>>>>>>>>.  Election system  >>>>>>>>>>

we made the prime minister so when we make that prime minister we make the  descion for all pakistan so when we changed that prime minister 

we have been only descion  minimum people required so  Consensus mechnism  Algorithm BlockChain  this same that 

when we have been write any thing in block we get that descion for all nodes which has been already conncted in the netwok  



when the all nodes in the has been make that descion  ||  agreement  like which task has been added that so this prcedure is called Consensus

mechnism Algorithm BlockChain .. 


we can be make that Consensus mechnism  Algorithm BlockChain own build  ->>>


>>>>>>>>>>>> uses of the BlockChain in Public records  >>>>>>>>>>>

(1) Land Titles        (2)   Vehicals   Regitration    (3)    Business INCorporation  


 (4)    Criminal REcorde    (5)     passports    (6) Birth Certificate 


(7)  Death Certificate     (8)  Vote Regitration      (9)  Voting Records        



(10)  Health / Saftey inspections       (11)  Court Records 



+++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Component of BlockChain ++++++++++++++++++++<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


(1)CryptoGrapgy   (2)  Validity Rule   (3)  p2p netwok  ->>  person to person transctions send

(4) ledger        (5)  Consensus mechnism


++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  challeges Faced in BlockChain ++++++++++++++ <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

  (1)  Schalibility 

  (2)  Processing Time 

  (3)  51%  attack 

  (4) Double Spending

  (5) Bad Smart Contract  

  (6) Storage

  (7) First Mile and Last Mile Problem 

  (8) Regulations

  (9) Public Preception 

  (10) Lack OF Skilled Staff 


+++++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>> crytpocurrency ++++++++++++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that works on a decentralized network using blockchain 

technology. Unlike traditional money, it is not controlled by any government or bank.

 Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary form of money that is digital, secure, and decentralized. 

 It is used for payments, investments, and powering decentralized applications



 +++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Consensus  mechnism Algorithm | Proof of Work  ++++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 Consensus Algorithm  this is tecniques || treqaqarr  in which all nodes  has been agreement and that so this called  Consensus Algorithm

 Example: in BlockChain minimum 100 nodes has been conncetd that with each other and and when in new things has been 

 added that so its give that agreement for  the all nodes  which has been conncted that in the network 

 Consensus  ->> means which things is required for agreement

 mechnism  ->> means all has been give the agreement
 

(1)   Proof of Work

  the  miner in blockchain is a person or a computer that validates and secures transactions on a blockchain network.

   This process is called mining, and it involves solving complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain.
   
    Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) for their work


  in network many node has been conncted that  with eachother so when the one node has been send that the transactions

  so all nodes recived the broadcast || message so transactions so the minner has been minging that 

  and validates the transactions when the minner has been validates the transactions so all nodes has been verify that 

  when the all nodes has been agreed that the minging so the minner has been get the rewards like bitcoins ...

  ++++++++++>>>> which things required for minging process ++++++++++>>>>>>>>>

  first thing your computer has been very fast and strong hardware and you electircity bill more appear

  accurate brain required 



  in proof of work more security and engerg consumed like 

  (1)  Nonce ->>>>>>>   minnner has been generated that random number 

  security  ->>>>>>>>>>  

  energy ->>>>>>>>>>>>   


  +++++++++++++++ >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Proof of  Stack ++++++++++++++>>>>>>>>

  proof os Stack will make the entire mining process virtual and replace minners with  validators ..

  in the proof os stack its has been same of the minging process  in the proof of stack set that the requirement only which person 

  has been start the mining which has been set that the bit like the minner has been want that mine so its has been first 

  set the 10 token for start the minging so when the minner has been lost that minging process its 10 token has been lost 

  that so when the minner has been win that the minging its has been get that the rewards according to the set that the bit during 

  minging so its minner is called validators ......


  stack ->>>  which has been set that the bit during minging ....

  ap janta ha ka mining ma reward milta totoaly ka  ha sab kay jab minner min karta ha tu as ap ju ap na 

  bet || shart lagai htoi ha like ap na 100 rupes lagai ha so as ka hisab sa ap ko feee milay ga as liya as ma minner to validaor khata ha 

  no block reward
